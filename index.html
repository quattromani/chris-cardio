      <h3><strong><em>Don’t think of criticism as a negative thing. Think of it as a challenge. </em></strong></h3>

      <p class="lede"><strong>Truth:</strong> We are our harshest critics.</p>
      <p class="lede">No one appreciates when another person intentionally or unintentionally points out the ONE “flaw” that they are MOST insecure about. Yet sometimes it happens and you either allow yourself to reflect on your insecurity, take it in stride and move on with your day in a positive manner, OR you let it negatively affect your demeanor for the rest of the day. <strong>IT IS A CHOICE.</strong></p>
      <hr>
      <p>Let’s face it, we all have our personal insecurities and hang ups; mental, physical, you name it – everyone has that one “thing.” It’s OKAY. Maybe you only have one (which is awesome!) However, I can admit I have a few hang ups and although I recognize that they are there day in and day out, I make a conscious mental effort to prohibit them from ruling my thoughts and my life. In fact, I choose to focus on the positive things in life, the things I love about myself and the simple pleasures that I appreciate every day. Does that mean I am immune to those negative thoughts creeping in? NO. They Creep… and they Creep and they creep, but<strong> I CHOOSE</strong> to shut them down OR to take them as a learning experience.</p>
      <p>My coaches, who’s job is to transform bodies into perfect human specimens, have pointed out ALL of my physical “flaws” because that is their job. Do I like hearing that my legs are smaller than my upper body, and that I could stand to gain muscle here and lose fat there? Not exactly. It’s hard to have your insecurities pointed out, or in some cases confirmed. However, I also understand that their criticism is something I chose to take on. I actually MADE MYSELF VULNERABLE, knowing that my every flaw would be found and put on display.The way I see it, I have two choices: to tackle those insecurities head on and to do something about them, OR to simply accept them as a beautiful part of me.</p>
      <p>I suppose my ultimate point here is that: Allowing yourself to be vulnerable to your own insecurities and to other’s criticism, to really hear it, soak it all in and make a choice as to what to do with it, is HARD WORK. No one wants to feel inadequate, SO DON’T. It is ENTIRELY your choice how you respond to criticism, self inflicted or otherwise. Choose to take life’s criticism as a challenge to be better,  spin it into a positive and grown from it. As I’ve said before, we don’t get better staying within our comfort zone. If we never allow ourselves to be vulnerable, then there’s no way we can expect to push the bounds of what is possible in our lives.</p>
      <p>So today I challenge you to live outside your comfort zone, to improve upon the aspects of your life you don’t like, OR to simply accept yourself flaws and all.</p>
